    "> - **Algorithm Description** will include the following:\n",
    ">   - how the algorithm works\n",
    ">   - the specific aspects of the physiology that it takes advantage of\n",
    ">   - a describtion of the algorithm outputs\n",
    ">   - caveats on algorithm outputs \n",
    ">   - common failure modes\n",
    "> - **Algorithm Performance** - Detail how performance was computed (eg. using cross-validation or train-test split) and what metrics were optimized for. Include error metrics that would be relevant to users of your algorithm. Caveat your performance numbers by acknowledging how generalizable they may or may not be on different datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your write-up goes here...\n",
    "\n",
    "> - **Code Description**\n",
    ">   - To run the code, RunPulseRateAlgorithm will take in two filenames and return a tuple of two numpy arrays--per-estimate pulse rate error and confidence values.  The Evaluate function can be also called on the Troika dataset to compute an aggregate error metric.\n",
    "> - **Data Description**\n",
    ">   - The Troika dataset is used to train and test the algorithm, including PPG signal from two wrists, but just one is applied, and IMU signal from three dimensions.  ECG signal and both PPG signals could be required to improve performance.\n",
    "> - **Algorithm Description**\n",
    ">   - A regression algorithm RandomForestRegressor is trained to fit the provided data.\n",
    ">   - It takes advantage of the ability for PPG sensor to detect the amount of red blood cells under the wrists.\n",
    ">   - The algorithm outputs are two numpy arrays: per-estimate pulse rate error and confidence values\n",
    ">   - Per-estimate pulse rate error is the absolute difference between the predicted value and the ground truth, and confidence value is the relative difference.\n",
    ">   - Common failure modes include hand motion and gesture movement.\n",
    "> - **Algorithm Performance**\n",
    ">   - Performance is computed based on K-fold cross-validation, and error is the absolute bias between the predicted value and the ground truth.  Test result is Error = 10.98, but due to the small sample size, it might not be generalizable on other datasets."
